== PW 2

* In this second PW, we will spit the original HTML template into three components:
** a header component in charge of displaying the header of the page (title and form input)
** a card component in charge of displaying each codelab information. This component will have on attribute : on object corresponding to the codelab information we want to display.
** a wrapper component containing all the page

* In this last component, initialize a fake list of codelabs we will use in our template.
